## Why FenixEdu Academic

FenixEdu Academic is a Student Information System, designed to work primarily with colleges. It handles all the back office work that schools have to handle like student schedules, teacher allocation, student credit management, etc. It is designed using our [FenixEdu Architecture](https://confluence.fenixedu.org/display/CMS/Welcome) and is fully extensible and pluggable, therefore it can be adapted to any type of institutions.
